Provide a short step by step instruction on setting up Nessus.

 

Nessus:

As I have said in the previous discussion Nessus is a vulnerability scanner. I decided to download and install Nessus on a Kali Virtual Machine. I then gave it a test on my own network at home. I actually found some vulnerabilities that I need to take care of.

First:You may need to go to Nessus.com and download the appropriate client. Unpacking Nessus 6.8.1 in linux and Starting the nessusd service. We also got the Kali url for the web ui for the nessus scanner.

 

Second: Navigating to https://kali:8834 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. URL. Also confirming Security exception for the website.

 

Third:. It will then bring you to a user and password registration page. You will have to input your activation key and activate your nessus. If you haven't gone to the website and retrieved your activation key you will need to register. Wait for Nessus to download and initialize.

 

Fourth: You will then be brought to the Nessus UI page. To start a scan you will need to customize your first scan in order to scan for vulnerabilities. Nessus has a whole range of different vulnerabilities checks.

 

Fifth: My scan of my network.

After reviewing the above, where can potential threats and vulnerabilities originate?

 

Looking at my router after the Nessus scan you can see a lot of different vulnerabilities. ASUS Router ‚Äòinfosvr‚Äô remote command execution vulnerability for one. ‚ÄúThe remote device is an ASUS router that contains firmware which is affected by a flaw in its 'infosvr' service due to not properly checking the MAC address of a request. An unauthenticated, remote attacker, using a crafted request to UDP port 9999, can exploit this to run arbitrary commands or access configuration details (including passwords) on the device.‚Äù - Nessus Knowlege Base. Nessus is so nice this way, it tells you what the vulnerability is and then tells you the best ways to secure the vulnerability. They also give you other resources to look up to better secure my device. Looks like I just have to upgrade my routers firmware. Which I did.

We did an vulnerability assignment for CSIA 6200. Where we uses different vulnerability tools. Some of these tools are NetDiscover, Nmap, and Nbtscan. NetDiscover is a tool on kali or backtrack linux that allows an user to discover different networks, and nodes on the networks. Nmap is  is another security vulnerability scanner, majority of what it is used for is port scanning. Nbtscan is a an IP scanning tool for scanning NetBIOS information.

The book describes how we use a secure network design to ensure that we have our networks segmented properly. The best way to help do this is to make sure we are monitoring and controlling traffic on our network. Best security practice is implementing firewalls, and Intrusion detection systems both inside and outside of our network, also using VPN to secure our connections from the outside in. In the undergraduate network security class we had a project where we set up an honeypot. A honeypot is a decoy history that traps hackers, or tracking/logging how the hacker broke into the honeypot. Honeypots are designed to lure hackers to try to attack the honeypot. If multiple honeypots are set up on one network it is called a honeynet. Potential vulnerabilities can originate from anywhere. As I stated before in a previous post I stated, ‚ÄúThese vulnerabilities come in different categories, physical protections, and Cyber Security. We have to have access for vulnerabilities in both the physical and cyber individually, also together. Understanding the entire system and the security behind that system allows security professionals to account for all vulnerabilities in a system. There are two methods of attack can originate from two directions, from the inside and outside. An example of an inside attack is employee with access tries installs a Malware on a POS machine skimming credit card information. An example of an attack from the outside is seal team six breaking into bin laden compound to kill bin laden.‚Äù

FYI: We just got an Informational Email about Ransomware at work warning us to be careful. It has been hitting companies. Ransomware has doubled other the last year.

Steven, I agree with you threats come from "Anywhere and everywhere". Not only in an organization but in our personal lives. You said, " however, a thief who is harder to detect and who could cause the most damage is the insider, the employee with legitimate access. The motivations and reasons behind these threats and vulnerabilities to your network or organization are many. Potential threats and vulnerabilities can, and often do, result from insider threats." I agree with you also on this point too. I was reading an article the other day about how the most serious threats come from the inside. The two domains of security (cyber and physical domain) are most vulnerable to attack from within.

Rob! I agree with you the most important thing is mobile devices. Like passwords posted on the monitors of coworkers. mobile security isnt where it needs to be. People using simple pins like 1234 and 0000. People not using two factor authentication, not encrypting wireless transmissions,  and most mobile devices dont contain security software. the kicker is that we keep our whole life on our phones, and we need to protect it just as much. I'm pretty impressed also with the nessus's ability to scan vulnerabilities.

I'm glad you brought up open wifi. Alot of my family and friends dont know the risks of public wifi. Especially when we access our  important information like banking information on public wifi. I'm eternally scared of public networks, even if I do use VPN or tunneling service when on a open network.

haha im glad you guys liked the video, but that wasnt me. If i ever record something i use fraps, but nvidia is coming out with a video recording software called shadow play. If you have windows ten then you can record stuff too with the windows 10 game bar. üòä
